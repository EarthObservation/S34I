Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) for shallow waters using nested boosting techniques 
==========================================================================================


This project implements an ensemble learning approach to predict bathymetry (Depth) based on Sentinel-2 input features, Bathymetry Map and Isobaths Contours.

The dataset (csv format) should include the following:

* Input features (bands)

A target column Depth
